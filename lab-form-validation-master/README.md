# ProGrad Lab | Form Validation

## A Quick Introduction

With the love for coding, our ProGrad Alumni have come up with a great product idea for all the future ProGrads - CODEPRO. CODEPRO is built with a vision to help other ProGrads host and review code, manage projects and collaborate alongside other ProGrads. The website looks splendid & they are gonna launch it this weekend. Obviously, we are damn proud of them ❤️

Well, they are currently busy finishing and fixing up other things. We thought you help them with fixing one minor bug - form validation. As a ProGrad, we thought you could do the best to help out your peers & our alumni.

## What should you do
```
Fork this repo
Clone this repo
Practice JavaScript basics - operators, conditions, loops
```

## How To Submit
```
Upon completion, run the following commands:

git add .
git commit -m "ProGrad ID"
git push origin master

And finally, create a pull request so your ProGrad Mentor (PM) can review your work.
```

## Instructions
Open script.js and follow the instructions.

## Progression 1:
```
check username
create a function called as checkUserName()
username should not be empty
username should be a minimum of 8 characters and above 
username should be less than 15 characters
no space is allowed in username
username should not contain special characters
the function should return true if all the above conditions are validated.
return false if the validation fails
```
## Progression 2: 
```
Check mail
create a function called as checkEmail()
only @ , . , _ [at,dot,underscore] is allowed
it can be alphanumeric in nature
return true if it passses all validations and false otherwise
```
## Progression - 3
```
Check password
create a function called as checkPassword()
should be alphanumeric in nature
password must contain atleast one Uppercase, one number and special characters[!@#$%^&*()_]
return true else return false
```

Happy Coding ProGrad ❤️
