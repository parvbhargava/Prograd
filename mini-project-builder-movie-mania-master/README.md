## What should you do

### Progression 1: GENERATE THE API KEY
Create an account in (https://www.themoviedb.org/). Once you create an account, go to settings and get your API key.

### Progression 2: POPULAR MOVIES IN ENGLISH
Use Axios for Fetch to fetch the data from https://www.themoviedb.org/ and display it as shown in the output.
