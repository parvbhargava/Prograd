# ProGrad Project-Builder | JS | WEATHER FORECAST

We have learned all the important concepts in JavaScript. Now lets work with our project builder in building a smartwatch, applying all of the concepts we have just learned.

## What should you do
```
Fork this repo
Clone this repo
Practice Fetch,Axios and Rest API Features
```

## How To Submit
```
Upon completion, run the following commands:

git add .
git commit -m "ProGrad ID"
git push origin master

And finally, create a pull request so your ProGrad Mentor (PM) can review your work.
```

### Progression 1: GET MY API
Create an account in (https://openweathermap.org/). Once you create an account, go to settings and get your API.

### Progression 2: WHAT'S THE WEATHER
Use Fetch to fetch the data from openweathermap api and display it as shown in the output.
